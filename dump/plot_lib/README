This is the Anmap map-display/plotting system.


 Update Log.
 -----------

 17/9/87:  Defined basic commands etc. and simple (non-plotting) routines.
 18/9/87:  More routines added, some commands changed.
 19/9/87:  Corrections to Contour input (new method) and scaling plot.
 20/9/87:  Corrections to frame scaling and contouring + general.
 21/9/87:  Addition of text plotting - corrected dashed-contours;
           cursor input and linear contours implemented
 22/9/87:  changes to command names (some removed). UV-box and grid
           options added, change to character representation of levels.
 23/9/87:  Corrections to some routines. Addition of "add-cross; 'C' in
           W-O-P; SET-CROSS-STYLE; NEXT-FRAME", correction to framing
           and character size definition.
 24/9/87:  Preparing for release; help written, bugs cleared up - only
           pips are unavailable.
 27/9/87:  Correction to CROSSes option, optionally fast contour algorithm
           installed. Line width option added.
 30/9/87:  Correction to map size handling and checking of "R" option.
 14/10/87: Pips added and tested; change to UVTORD calls throughout.
           (This will need looking at again).
           READ-MAP command added to this sub-system.
 17/10/87: Corrections to pips (setup up STPROJ parameters consistent
           with the "quick" precession routine PRECES).
           Correction to printing of contour levels and the handling of
           the zero contour.
 17/11/87: Installation of OVERLAY-MAP and FAST-CONTOUR commands. Change
           to the way contours are labelled (stop at bottom of plot and
           only those plotted are recorded). OUTPUT-DEVICE now handled
           by io_getplt; DATE and program name plotting installed.
 11/12/87: EXPLAIN now uses updated HELP_UTIL program. Set-output-device
           now does an end-plot.
 21/12/87: LINEAR-CONTOURS and LOGARITHMIC-CONTOURS now have proper error
           checking of user inputs before setting up the contour levels.
 12/01/88: Modification to allow calling of BASIC-COMMANDS.
           Change in style of wording on output plot.
 21/01/88: Update state is correctly handled during output to the
           Pericom -- this should stop screen flicker.
 24/03/88: The number of commands has been reduced (by adding multiple
           option commands) and some bugs have been fixed. All routines
           requiring 'UV-range' input can now read from the graphics
           screen if required (and appropriate).
 14/09/88: All routines now forced to access STATUS using the routine
           argument. All variables defined so that $inplicit off may be
           used.
 21/09/88: Proper interpolation option installed for contouring which
           by default will be off. INTMAP is now used to interpolate the
           required UV region into the work array. This must occur each
           time PLT_DOCONT is called so as to be able to correctly
           release space in the work array for other utilities.
 20/1/89:  More corrections to linear-contours and log-contours
 13/02/89: New DISPLAY command replaces show commands
 23/03/89: Substantial changes to plot library in the way
           overlay maps are handled. New include file format.
           Grey-scales improved. Colours for LEXI enhanced.
           Drawing-sys allows redefinition of frame.
 22/08/89: plot_TVmod and internal functions for setting colour
           table moved to PLOT-COL-TABLE and enhanced colour
           option added.
 23/10/89: bug fixed in interpolation option for large maps
 14/12/89: added support for vector plotting
 05/03/90: added plotting of symbols representing special data
 01/05/90: new option to allow full use of plotting area
 20/06/90: cursor-position command added to display sub-system
 11/03/91: standard get-type command added to plot system
 20/11/91: additional options to frames and graphics overlay
 16/12/91: new surface plot option to do a surface plot in a graphics
           overlay window.
 01/04/92: SUNOS version started; added support for external TV device
           via command TV-load. Rename TV-modify to modify-lookup-table.
 15/01/93: Major re-write to use ne graphic object oriented approach.
           Many routines removed from map-display and now treated as
           additional graphics options: slice, surface-plot, TV-load.
