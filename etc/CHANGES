Changes file to Anmap version X....
-----------------------------------

---------
19/11/95:
o minor bug fixes to paths; defined env(SPECTRUM).
o updated help for fractal calculation and cluster analysis and properly
  defined the commands
o re-instated initialisation of synchrotron analysis code.

--------
20/7/95:
o new command angular-flux in map-analysis.
o general small improvements to the help and help sub-directory (one item
  removed from wishlist). (X0.53g)
  
--------
13/7/95:
o Added a number of command-line options to startup scripts for Anmap.  This
  greatly improves the way users can startup anmap.  Scripts anmap and
  Xanmap are now the same except for the default options.  Users can
  select anmap, Xanmap, Xanmap without a new window, working directory,
  mapsize (very useful), number of maps. (X0.53f)

-------
6/7/95:
o Multi-fit in mapanalysis broken.  Opportunity taken to rework external program so
  that it uses the catalogue and not maplib directly and also does not use the
  extra redtape.  User interface reworked in tcl completely. (X0.53e)

--------
25/6/95:
o Bugs fixed in CLEAN and write-data-file; CLEAN_PROGRAM reworked and spawning of
  the clean process moved to tcl level (X0.53c)
o Bug in plotting of RA/DEC grid fixed --- applied Dave T. patch.
o released version X0.53d

--------
23/2/95:
o Finished imcat routine to provide access to catalogue functions as an
  inteligent wrapper to iclPriv.  Implemented prrocedures which cover all
  the functionality of mapcat_sys and removed call to mapcat_sys.
o Map-catalogue module updated to implement all of the sub-system in tcl;
  many commands improved by this change.
o New documented, supported mechanism to handle multiple catalogues via a
  single load-catalogue command --- older commands removed.
o Help on map-catalogue, imcat, iclPriv written/updated.
o Help on iolib.tcl written
o Help updated on tcl programming generally.
o New information on last written maps now available via imcat result option.
o Read-data-file Write-data file implemented as external programs for ease
  of maintenance.
o Switched to new PGPLOT version 5.0 (no new code just re-linked).
o Released version X0.53.
o Initial bugs take version to X0.53b

--------
16/2/95:
o DJT fixed bug in FITS code, incorporated in Anmap.
o New tcl command iclPriv added to access the map-catalogue and a tcl
  wrapper procedure imcat was written to support most map-catalogue
  operations.
o Tcl code generally tidied, internal change to "?" help system to
  reduce the number of global variables (no *.info globals now).
o New modules added map-catalogue, edit-redtape and all modules moved
  to Anmap(src)/etc.
o New options list and loaded added to the module command.
o Version incremented to X0.52e and released.

--------
11/2/95:
o Changed set-map in map-display to reset the title of the plot.
o Changed initialisation to load ra module by default.
o Removed obsolete (and dangerous) catalogue-system "directory" commands.
o Removed obsolete advanced-mode command from catalogue-system

--------
24/7/94:
o Finally tidied up directories so that the old anmap directory could
  be removed (in fact moves to test/dump/old_anmap for safety). map*
  include files moved to include and re_lib re-built.

--------
15/7/94:
o Added command to correct CAT primary beam in ra_lib --- needs documenting.

---------
26/06/94:
o Fixed bug in vectors rotation.

---------
==> Advertised Release is at this stage X0.52d
---------
30/04/94:
o Added new nmr tools nmr_readSerial nmr_readImage nmr_readAmpPhase
  and moved all to nmr_tools.  Updated module nmr.
o New tool Aphi_RealImag in tools.  Converts to/from Amp/Phase and
  Real/Imaginary images.
o Created a module map-analysis for ALL map-analysis commands and added
  Aphi_RealImag as a new command.  Modified standard_init, standard_info
  and the default init_anmap.tcl to reflect the new module.

---------
==> Advertised Release is at this stage X0.52c
---------
12/04/94:
o Fixed the bug in CLEAN which was making it impoossible for people to
  use CLEAN.  Not the working image directory is now exported using the
  MAPSDIR environment variable.  This is set to a default value in 
  etc/init_anmap.tcl

---------
==> Advertised Release is at this stage X0.52b
---------
29/03/94:
o Added inverted scale-bar option by modifying use of sclae_bar_opt.
  Also changed scale_bar_text so both are now integers. Advertise this
  in the next release!!

---------
==> Advertised Release is at this stage X0.52a
---------
11/03/94:

1) Implemented changes to the sycnhrotron analysis system ready for
   version X0.52; ra_lib now used and not synch_sys.  Module ra now
   contains deifnitions of all the synchrotron-analysis routines
2) Added error output to multi-slice-fit and added this command to
   nmr.module.
3) Made a number of nmr.module command globals commands.
4) Altered redtape command to use edit-redtape sub-system
5) Moved much code to anm_lib and introduced anm_dispatch as the
   command dispatching routine.
6) Installed an X-windows interface to the synchrotron analysis tools
   and updated help
7) Eliminated alpha-map in synchrotron analysis in favour of using fit-maps,
   but introduced an alpha-map procedure.
8) Released version X0.52a.

---------
04/03/94:

1) Updated help for data-display and map-display, now up to date
2) Fixed bug in grid plotting by importing old routine from the NORD
 o Released version 0.51h

---------
03/03/94:

1) Added support for limits in data display
2) Added ability to execute code from a ted session launched from Anmap
   to aid in developping procedures -- see tcllib/Anmap_Ted.tcl
3) Updated help: command-line editing
4) Removed debugging statements in plot_sys : plot_doframe ...
5) Modified do_smooth to remove annoying limits, unecessary output and
   extra prompt at end of session; bug fixed using wrong data type for
   beam widths
6) Eliminated extra text in delete-catalogue-entry
7) Fixed bu in use of crosses file so that user is now NOT prompted
   for "one-extra" cross.
8) Added hypertext help
 o Released version 0.51g

---------
25/02/94:

1) Updated anm_lib to group basic Anmap subroutines, will now eventually
   hold all non-analysis code.  Added standard routines to startup a
   f77 routine with tcl support.  Updated tcl support routines, updated
   iocmd routines.
2) New synchrotron analysis system, moved code to ra_lib with intenstion
   of removing synch_sys.  Code made tcl compliant.
3) Changed basic operation of Xanmap to use Desktop environment and
   menu system.  Removed non Anmap specific items from menus.
4) Serious bug fixed in stack allocation routine which failed to update
   all of the interlock flags correctly.  Moved stack and mapcat under
   the Anmap tree.
5) Changed SAOIMAGE path to the full path to avoid problems with
   user aliases.
