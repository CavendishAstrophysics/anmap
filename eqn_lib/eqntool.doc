	_e_q_n_t_o_o_l reads equations either from a file or strings
	specified on the command line or from the standard input.
	These equations can be differented, expanded, clean,
	and are normally printed on the standard output.

	Each argument of the program is read in turn and immediately
	acted upon. Hence the order they appear is important. The
	possible options are:-

	_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e	All the equations in the file are read in.

	----		Equations are read in from the standard input
			until EOF (control-D) is encountered.

	_e_q_u_a_t_i_o_n	An set of equations is read in from the command
			line. Normally its best if the equations are
			enclosed in single quotes,
			e.g. eeeeqqqqnnnnttttoooooooollll ''''x+y''''
			Note if the equation is a valid filename then
			the equations will be read in from that file instead.

	----cccc		Flip the clean flag. If the clean flag is set
			then all equations read in so far and all the
			following equations will be cleaned up. For example
			If the clean flag is set the equation 'sin(Pi/6)'
			becomes '0.5'. The clean flag is ON by default.

	----dddd _n_a_m_e		Differentiate all the equations with respect
			to _n_a_m_e.

	----eeee		Flip the expand flag. If the expand flag is set
			then all equations read in so far and all the
			following equations will be expanded. For example
			If the expand flag is set the equation '(x+y)^2'
			becomes 'x*x+x*y+y*x+y*y'.i
			The expand flag is OFF by default.

	----ffff		Flip the function flag. If the function flag is set
			then the standard list of functions will be
			used in all the equations read in so far and all the
			following equations. If the function flag is set
			'cos(x)' will be recognized as a function, otherwise
			'cos' will be treated as a variable and 'cos(x)'
			becomes 'cos * x'. The function flag is ON by default.

	----FFFF	Print out the definitions of the standard function.
