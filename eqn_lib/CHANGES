Changes/bug fixes and additions to eqn library

version 2.0 25/8/93

	First off there was one critical bug.
	When trying to convert equations in three varibles into
	polynomials messed up whenever the term -z was encountered.

	A slight change in interpratation of equations,
	a/b(c) is now interprated as a/(b(c)) if b has been declaired
	as a function and (a/b)(c) otherwise. It use to always be
	a/(b(c)). This also effects a/b c. See the section on functions
	for more details. Note the call set_input_functions is
	now required for function definitions to be used.

	Operators like diff(eqn,name) can now be added.

	Attemps to handle vectors with dot product . vector product ^
	addition/subtraction + - . This bit works but is still at
	a developement stage. (Would like to have user definable
	vector functions eg unit(v) ).

	Some new function definition usable in equations
		abs
		sgn
		max
		min
		if

	Lots of new c-subroutines added:
		count_eqn_args
		copy_node
		free_eqn_node
		join_eqn
		join_dup_eqn
		get_eqn_arg
		add_operator
		eval_ops
		set_input_functions
		get_input_functions
		make_vrpe
		eval_vrpe
		fprint_vrpe
		print_vrpe
	and some macros
		eqn_op
		eqn_l
		eqn_r
		eqn_val
		eqn_name
		eqn_fun
		eqn_arg
		eqnop
		eqnl
		eqnr
		eqnval
		eqnname
		eqnfun
		eqnarg
		remove_eqn_names
		num_eqn_names
		get_eqn_names
		

THINGS TO DO
		Add the subroutines
			add_internal_mapping
			add_external_mapping
		and deal with general mappings from R^n to R^m.

		Rework the substitution mechinism so that if we have
			X = a * b ;
			a = x + y;
			b = x - y;
		we can find the value of X and its derivative with
		out having to substitute in the equations for a and b.
