Spectrum Analysis Library
-------------------------

The routines in this library perform basic spectral analysis tasks.  The
routines fall into two main groups, the user callable routines with the
prefix "spec_" and the internal routines with the prefix "spi_".  Only
the user callable routines should be included in any application programs.
