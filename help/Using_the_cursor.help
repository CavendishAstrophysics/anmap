Information: on use of the cursor

Most the the interactive graphics devices we have support input from the
cursor. There are a number of places when cursor input can be used:

1) Some commands will prompt for a uv-position and offer a default of
   "[cursor]" - pressing return will make the cursor appear and you will
   then have the cursor appear for input

2) In response the any prompt for a uv-range you may specify "Cursor"
   (or any valid abbreviation) and you may then specify the uv-range
   using the cursor by marking two corner of the uv-box.

3) Some special command clearly activate the cursor - e.g.
   cursor-position (which may be called at any time).

It is clearly important that you measure uv-positions/ranges etc. from
the same map which you are trying to process - the uv-position returned
is taken from the map on the SCREEN.

When you have positioned the cursor, simply press any printing character
character (A-Z or a-z are best) except Q (or q) - the latter stands for
Quit and is equivalent to typing ESC in reponse to a normal prompts
(unfortunately the graphics interface routines do not understand ESC or
other control characters and in general when the cursor appears you
should avoid typing ESC, RETURN or other non-printing characters).
