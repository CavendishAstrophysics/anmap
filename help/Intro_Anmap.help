Basic information to introduce you to ANMAP.

*1 Preface

Anmap is short for ANalysis-MAP and is the name given to the
image and data reduction software package on the SUN cluster and
Norsk Data NORD computers at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory.
 
Help provides extensive information on how to use the package.  Commands
exist to do a variety of things to images and spectral-type data. 
Commands are grouped into sub-systems and in general you will need to
change to a particular sub-system in order to access the available
commands.  A few commands are avalailable in all subsystems, such
as help, news and commands provided directly by the command language.
You will need to enter a sub-level of ANMAP in order to perform any serious
work. See the help entry on sub-systems for more detail.

Anmap uses the concept of a catalogue of maps.  The catalogue is maintained
separately from the filing system of your computer and provides a simple
way of organising your work.

*1 Sub-systems

Sub-systems are entered by typing the name of the sub-system -- having
done this you will have a new list of commands specific to the sub-system
you have entered. The sub-systems currently available are

graphic-system          --     control graphic output
map-display             --     to display maps as contours etc.
map-analysis            --     to analyse and manipulate maps
clean-system            --     run CLEAN on your map
edit-redtape            --     editing a map redtapes
edit-image              --     interactive editing of images
synchrotron-analysis    --     analysing synchrotron spectra
scratch-display         --     control display of scratch images
data-display            --     display 1D data
drawing-display         --     a drawing subsystem to annotate plots
spectrum-analysis       --     analyse spectral-type files
catalogue-system        --     monitoring the catalogue



*1 command_syntax

Commands fall into a number of categories within Anmap, but
the most important category are those commands which provide direct 
access to Anmap's analysis facilities.  These commands have descriptive
names and the commands available in a given sub-system can be listed
by typing a "?" character.

Each descriptive command consists of a number of parts each 
separated by a dash '-'. Upper and lower-case characters are not
distinguished in commands. The command interpreter matches 
each part of the command separately, you only need to type as 
much of the command as is necessary to make it unambiguous. 
The simplest way to see how this works is via an example. The 
command list-catalogue lists the contents of the map-catalogue 
(see below). To use this command the user may type any one of 
the following abbreviations:

       li-cat
       list-c
       l-c

however, the simple

       list

is not sufficient as there is also a command list (this is in
fact a command which is part of the command language itself, see
later).

If the abreviation you supply is not sufficient, then you will be
told it is ambiguous

*** Ambiguous command

The data for a particular command is given after the command: you
may type on the same line as the command the responses to the prompts
which would normally follow after specifying the command name.
If more than one data item or response is given on the command
line than they may be separated by commas ',' or spaces. If
you do not know what data a particular command is expecting
then the program will give an informative prompt.



Examples:

       delete-catalogue-entry 6

delete-catalogue takes an argument which is the catalogue entry
of the map you want to delete and requests for confirmation before
deleting the map from the catalogue.

       scan-map 1,,,,,

Scan-map takes a map-catalogue entry and a UV-range -- in this
example the default of the complete map is used.



When you are prompted for some input the default to the
command is shown in square brackets '[', ']'. Round brackets
are used to show possible responses. The default may be
obtained by pressing CR.



Examples:

       File-name [~/images/*.map] :    CR


In this example a default directory and file type are
indicated -- if you do not supply these the defaults are used.

       Projection (equatorial,sky,tangent) [sky] :    equat

The user is prompted for the projection of the output map in
the reproject command, the valid replies are either
equatorial, sky or tangent and the default (obtained on
pressing carriage return) is sky, in this example the user has
chosen equatorial.

In addition to the commands which act directly on data there are
also a wide range of commands which form the command language, called
tcl.  These commands cannot be "minimally-matched" (to avoid
as much as possible you typing them in error), but must be typed
exactly.  The command language will not be described in detail 
here, but it is extremely powerful and provides a programming
laanguage in its own right including the ability to create and
modify windows in the X-window version of Anmap.

*1 Accessing_UNIX_commands

To access a standard unix command all you have to do is to type
it!! In this sense Anmap looks just like a normal UNIX shell and
you can start programs etc. in the same way as you would do it
under UNIX itself.  As an example we can list the files in the
current directory using "ls" or "ls *.dat" to list all data files.
In fact any UNIX command which does not match an Anmap/tcl command
may be types in response to any prompt expecting an Anmap/tcl
command.  The most common UNIX commands you will want to use are:

  ls, pwd, cd, rm, mv, more

All work as expected!

As a second  example, to launch an editor to edit a text file you 
could just type at the Anmap> (or any other sub-system) prompt:

Anmap>  editor my_file.text &

or

Anmap> emacs my_file.text &

to use the editor "editor" or "emacs" to edit the file. 

*1 Prompts_and_help

Each sub-system has its own prompts:

 Sub-System             Prompt              --  Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 BASIC-SYSTEM           Anmap>              --  The basic ANMAP system

 MAP-ANALYSIS           Map-Analysis>       --  Analysing maps

 MAP-DISPLAY            Map-Display>        --  Contouring and grey-scales

 DATA-DISPLAY           Data-Display>       --  Display 1D data

 SCRATCH-DISPLAY        Scratch>            --  Control scratch plots

 DRAWING-DISPLAY        Drawing>            --  Drawing system

 SPECTRUM-ANALYSIS      Spec-analysis>      --  Analysing spectral files

 GRAPHIC-SYSTEM         Graphic>            --  Control of Anmap graphics

 CLEAN                  Clean>              --  CLEANing maps

 EDIT-REDTAPE           Edit-Redtape>       --  Redtape correction

 EDIT-IMAGE             Edit-Image>         --  Image/map editing

 SYNCHROTRON-ANALYSIS   Synchrotron>        --  Analysing synchrotron spectra

 CATALOGUE-SYSTEM       Map-Catalogue>      --  Map-Catalogue commands


You start off in the basic-system - to return to it from any
other sub-system just type exit or quit -- these commands
typed in response to the Anmap> prompt will leave Anmap and
return to the operating system. To switch to a different
sub-system simply give the name of the sub-system as a command
and you will notice that the prompt will change.

[ If you are running X_anmap then exiting Anmap will cause the main
Anmap window to be deleted together with the graphics (PGPLOT)
window.  Other windows (such as the TV window) will need to be
removed explicitly.  You may also choose to exit Anmap by chooseing
the Exit-Anmap menu item from the Anmap menu available under
X-windows. ]

At any time you can list the available commands by typing a
'?' which  will list all the commands available in the
current sub-system while typing for example '? examine' will
list all commands matching this string. For example in the
basic-system the following will tell you about edit-redtape,
edit-file and edit-image:

     ? edit-

You may obtain considerably more information by using help;
a menu of items help knows about will be displayed. To obtain 
information on a particular topic, for example the map-catalogue, 
simply type the name of the entry of interest. Let us suppose you 
type map-cat (note that minimal matching applies). On the screen
will be displayed a few lines of introduction to the map
catalogue and then there will appear a new menu of things help
knows about in connection with the map-catalogue; as we will
presume you are new to Anmap, type intro and the information
listed under the Introduction will be typed. On completion of
this information you will still be at the level of help
information on the map catalogue -- to re-display the menu
type:

       ? CR

or to return to the basic menu of what help knows about simply
type CR. To return to the Anmap> prompt keep pressing CR until
the prompt re-appears on your screen.



*1 breaking_out_of_commands

You may interrupt the program at any prompt by pressing ^Y (Control-Y).
This should return you to the current sub-system prompt. Note that 
this will happen immediately in response to a prompt, but there 
may be a considerable delay if some work is being done on an 
image as the effect is carefully controlled so that you do not 
lose any data.

*1 Anmap Command-line options

Anmap supports a number of command line options:

       -help        = This message
       -cd [dir]    = Specify working directory as dir [~/mrao]
       -cwd         = Do not change to a working directory [no]
       -swd         = Change to standard working directory [yes]
       -X           = Startup Xanmap [yes]
       -noX         = Startup anmap [no]
       -winX        = Startup X anmap in own window [yes]
       -nowinX      = Startup X anmap in current window [no]
       -mapsize [s] = Set standard map size [256]
       -nmaps [n]   = Set number of maps [20]
       -buffsize [s]= Set standard buffer size [1024]
       -nbuff [n]   = Set number of buffers [4]

This enables you to start Xanmap with the anmap command as:

	anmap -X

If you do not want to have a separate embedded Xterm you can use:

	anmap -X -nowinX
or
	Xanmap -nowinX

By default Anmap changes directory to ~/mrao.  You can now overide this
with the option "-cwd" or change to another directory with the options
"-cd dir".  If you are analysing large images then you will find the
"-mapsize" options very useful.  For example if your standard image size
is 1024x1024, then you should probably start Anmap with:

	anmap -mapsize 512

It is not necessary to specify your actual map size as the amount of reserved
storage is in fact:

	nmaps * mapsize**2
