TOOLS
-----

This directory contains the source for standard SPECTRUM tools.

To link a particular tool use the following:

  f77 -xl tool_name.f -o $MRAO_SOURCE/bin/spec/tool_name `spec_libs` \
          `nag` `pgplot`

Where `nag` and `pgplot` need only be included if the NAG library or
graphics respectively are required by the tool.  All tools should
be documented in the directory $MRAO_SOURCE/spec/docs.

The command file build.com makes each entry in the tools definition
using the make-file Makefile.
